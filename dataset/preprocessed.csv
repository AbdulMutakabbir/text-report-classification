remitters of the e-transfers were using names such as Marijuana,

through an unusual transaction report due to a $50,000 over the
counter cash transaction which was used to pay a Datathon Express
credit card card. When asked about the source of the funds Mary advised
that it was savings that she kept in her home.
Account Analysis
Mary’s accounts and over the counter transactions were reviewed
between August 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019. The following is a summary
of the activity. Over the counter transactions During the review
period Mary completed two over the counter transactions. The first
was on October 10, 2018, Mary used $10,000 in cash to
make a credit card payment to her DATATHON Visa. The second was on
November 21, 2018, Mary used $53,540 in cash to make a payment for
$50,000 to a Datathon Express credit card and deposit $3,450 into her
account.
Two large cash transaction reports were completed for the cash
Page 7 of 9transactions and Mary advised that the funds were savings from another
FI. During a KYC interview completed with Mary on January 8, 2019 Mary
advised again that the cash was savings that has accumulated over
approximately a one year period and were the proceeds of several rental
properties that Mary owns. She advised that she has issues with some of
her tenants cancelling cheques and now prefers to be paid in cash. Mary
advised that she owned 4 rental properties, two in Bangley BC; 11123 80A
Ave and 1234 206th St. which she has since sold, one in Murrey, BC; 11-
11234 24th Ave which has also been sold and one in Malta Lake, Maryvale;
1123 56th Ave. Open source searches revealed that the location in
Bangley sold on March 13, 2018 but that the location in Murrey was
removed from the market Sept 6, 2017 [1] [2]. However, during a follow-up
interview completed in January, 2019 when Mary was asked to provide
documentation to support her claim of rental income, she advised the
funds had been held in a safe in her home since 2016 because her mother
was a heavy gambler and had repaid Mary for a loan.
Mary was unable to provide any documentation regarding the source of the
cash.

Jonah’s Construction in Malta Lake with the same e-mail address used to
receive the EMTs. [4]
Other debits included 31 payments totaling $17,600 which consisted of
credit card, utility and mortgage payments.
There were no transactions in the USD account during the review period.
There were no transactions on the Master Card. A review of the Visa
revealed several large purchases at Westside Windows and what appears to
be a Visa payment to her TD Visa.
","Although a significant portion of Mary’s activity did
align with the information she provided in the KYC interview, given
Mary’s changing stories regarding the cash deposited and her inability
to provide any documentation supporting the source of the funds the
cash transactions are deemed suspicious and a STR will be reported to
HRM.
